            <h3>Ballet<hr></h3>
            I started going to ballet when I was only 5 and a half years old and I went regulary for 11 years. I danced in "Studio for modern ballet-Gazeli".
            I stopped going regulary when I was 16 but I still participate in events with the studio that I went to. The last event that I participated was a Carnival.
            During the 11 years that I was a member in the studio we went to many competitions and got so many awards. We went to competitions in other countries as well in Macedonia. Some of the countries that I had competed are:
            Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia...

            <h3>Gym<hr></h3>
            Another hobby of  mine is going to the gym. I have been working out for around 4 years.
            I love working out and lifting weights, it calms me down when I am stressed and overwhelmed. When the gyms closed because of the Corona virus
            I continued excersising from home but as soon as they opened I went back again. I tend to work out 4-5 times a week and I have a split for each day.
